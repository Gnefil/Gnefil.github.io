# R language
---
## *What? And why?*
`R` is a language developed in open source environment. It is an interpreted language that does not need to be compiled by a compiler, and allows rapid programming with its interactive commandline interface (similar to the Python one) and scripting.

Due to its straightforwardness, it is widely used in data mining and data analysis. As one of the most commonly used programming language, it is worthy to have a brief introduction about it.

## Rstudio
We hardly ever just write code from the commandline, and even less if the language we are using is mainly to get visual analysis on the data. Therefore, the most common way to use `R` is by `Rstudio`, a Graphical User Interface sofware to develop R code.
