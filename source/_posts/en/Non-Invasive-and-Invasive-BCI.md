subtitle: Brain Computer Interface (BCI) always had a role in utopic future. It is an ambitious technology that connects human brain with digital computers. If one day, we can choose to have a BCI connected, how would you choose between these two main branches; non-invasive BCI or invasive BCI?

# Introducing BCI

Brain Computer Interfaces are systems that read and interpret electrical signals from brain’s intention and execute them via an external device instead of one’s own body, Figure 1 is a visual example. The current progress in BMI is divided into two main methodologies, by the way sensors are placed: non-invasive BMI and invasive BMI. Due to its increase in popularity and prominent results, an overview of the characteristics of each method is a topic worth examining. The following essay aims to discuss the different advantages and disadvantages that each brings. Non-invasive methods in contrast to the invasive methods, are merited by the global scale detection and safeness, they offer a more convenient way in respect to its social acceptance and have an unreplaceable niche. On the other hand, invasive methods have advantages over non-invasive in the higher quality and transfer rate, in their large potential to optimise current techniques and it is still an area to be explored.
